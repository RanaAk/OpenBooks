Welcome to **OpenBooks**! 📖 This app is for readers who love free access to literature. Currently, it fetches books from the **Google Books API** with plans to incorporate even more open-source book libraries in the future. 📚✨

## 🌟 Features

- **Free Book Collection**: Access a variety of free books at no cost! 💸
- **Categories**: Filter books by popular genres.
  - All
  - Fiction
  - Mystery
  - Romance
  - Action
  - History
  - Biography
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface for seamless browsing.
- **Upcoming Enhancements**: We aim to add more sources and offer an even wider selection.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the app up and running on your device:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RanaAk/OpenBooks.git
   ```

2. **Setup API Access**:  
   The app currently fetches data from the Google Books API. Developers who want to access the data for testing or other purposes will need their own Google Books API key. Insert your API key in the appropriate file.

3. **Run on Xcode**:  
   Open the project in Xcode, connect your device or choose a simulator, and hit `Run`!

## 🔄 Future Roadmap

- **More Sources**: Expand the app to fetch books from additional open-source repositories, giving users even more reading options.
- **Enhanced Categories**: Adding custom and user-specific categories for better book discovery.
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to create profiles to save their reading history.

## 🧑‍💻 For Developers

Developers looking to experiment with the app's functionality or adapt it for other APIs will need to:

- Replace the API call in the relevant file with their own API endpoint and API key.
- Adjust the data model to match the structure of their new data source, if necessary.
